## Flex GPA Simulator

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to predict your SGPA and CGPA by manipulating the Grades on the Flex Student Portal.

## Need

As the finals approach most of us have a curiousity of guessing our grades in particular subject and what that predicted grade would
result in in terms of SGPA .
These predictions make us go to different GPA caluclators on the web and manually enter all the Courses , credit hours and ofcourse their grades
which seems very annoying if we have to calculate the cgpa for more than one semesters.
